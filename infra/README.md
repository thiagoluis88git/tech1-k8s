## Description

The Fast food project uses `AWS Cloud` to host its software components. 

## AWS VPC Description

To follow some of the best practices of network security in Cloud, the FastFood API uses the Private and Public network strategy to configure the `VPC` on **AWS**. This configuration can be created via `AWS Cloud Formation` using [this YAML file](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/cloudformation/2020-10-29/amazon-eks-vpc-private-subnets.yaml). The **most important** aspect for this *hybrid* solution is:

- Software components are stored in `Private Subnets`
- Infrastructure components, such as `NAT Gateways` are stored in `Public Subnets`
- The `EKS Load Balancers Services` will traffic the internet data between applications inside **Private Subnets**
- All the traffic between **Private Subnets** and **Public Subnets** are done by `Route tables`

With this approach the **FastFood API** is secure and safe from possible internet attackers.


### AWS RDS ###

This API uses the `AWS RDS` with **PostgreSQL** for relational database data saving. To keep it **private** and **safe** the *RDS* are stored in `Private Subnets` within the VPC mentioned above. By doing this, only the `internal applications` can access the **database**. `No one outside the cluster` can access the database.

## AWS EKS

The main AWS product used in FastFood project is `AWS EKS`. To know more about this configuration, read: [Kubernetes README](k8s/README.md)
